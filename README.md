In progress voxel tower defense game made in Godot. If I ever complete it, I plan on publishing it somewhere (maybe Steam), and leaving it open source.

Right now, there's only very basic features. There's procedural generation that just samples noise, and voxel mesh generation. Though, these are multithreaded.

Still needs a lot of optimization and refactoring (and physics!). I'm new to Godot, so please excuse any dumbness.
